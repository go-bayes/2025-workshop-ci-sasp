### Workshop logistics
**Date:** Wednesday, 19 November 2025, 09:00–16:00  
**Location:** University of Melbourne (Parkville campus), room TBA  
**Format:** In-person pre-conference workshop (registration via SASP abstract submission)
:::

## Overview

Social psychological theories aim for causal explanations, yet our evidence is often associational. This full-day, practice-oriented workshop introduces modern causal inference for observational data, with an emphasis on discovering for whom effects are strongest.
j
Here, we will:

- Diagnose confounding and other threats to causal claims in observational studies.  
- Use the potential outcomes framework and causal diagrams to keep assumptions explicit.  
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art estimators: doubly robust machine learning using causal forests.
- Translate workflow principles into hands-on R practice.  


## Objectives

Participants will leave with:

- A conceptual toolkit for articulating and evaluating causal claims.  
- Annotated R code for simulating and estimating average and heterogeneous treatment effects.  
- A curated reading list for self-study.  
- Examples of how to communicate causal results to academic, policy, and organisational audiences.

The workshop assumes familiarity with regression and R, but no prior training in causal inference.

## Technical setup

1. Install the current version of R (free) from <https://cran.r-project.org/>.  
2. Install RStudio Desktop (free) from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.  
3. Install the workshop packages:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("go-bayes/causalworkshop")

# Optional packages for extended demonstrations
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/margot")
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/boilerplate")
```

Once installed, run:

```r
library(causalworkshop)
check_workshop_prerequisites()
```

Download the reproducible scripts:

```r
library(causalworkshop)

get_workshop_scripts()  # copies scripts into ./workshop-scripts
list_workshop_scripts()
```

Work through scripts 01–05 in order to rehearse the workflow we will cover together.

## Workshop materials

- Case study PDFs and handouts live in the `pdfs/` directory.  
- Lecture notes are in `content/` and `glossary-and-dags.qmd`.  
- Student presentations will be posted here after the workshop.  
- Previous talks and examples remain available for reference; we will link to them from the relevant sections.
