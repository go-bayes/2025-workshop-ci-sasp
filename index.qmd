### Workshop logistics
**Date:** Wednesday, 19 November 2025, 09:00–16:00  
**Location:** University of Melbourne (Parkville campus), room TBA  
**Format:** In-person pre-conference workshop (registration via SASP abstract submission)
:::

## Overview

Social psychological theories aim for causal explanations, yet our evidence is often associational. This full-day, practice-oriented workshop introduces modern causal inference for observational data, with an emphasis on discovering for whom effects are strongest.

Here, we will:

- diagnose confounding and other threats to causal claims in observational studies.  
- use the potential outcomes framework and causal diagrams to keep assumptions explicit.  
- demonstrate state-of-the-art estimators: doubly robust machine learning using causal forests.
- translate workflow principles into hands-on R practice.  


## Objectives

Participants will leave with:

- A conceptual toolkit for articulating and evaluating causal claims.  
- Annotated R code for simulating and estimating average and heterogeneous treatment effects.  
- A curated reading list for self-study.  
- Examples of how to communicate causal results to academic, policy, and organisational audiences.

The workshop assumes familiarity with regression and R, but no prior training in causal inference.

### A note on pace
Please do not worry if the math or code looks intimidating at first glance. We'll slow everything down, build each idea together from first principles, and keep the focus on intuition before symbols. Bring your curiosity, bring coffee, and if you want to do the R exercise at the end, bring your laptop preloaded with twhe workshop package (see below). By the end of the day you'll see that the machinery is manageable -- and even fun (really!) -- when we unpack it step by step.

## Setup

1. Install the current version of R (free) from <https://cran.r-project.org/>.  
2. Install RStudio Desktop (free) from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.  
3. Install the workshop packages:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("go-bayes/causalworkshop")

# optional packages for extended demonstrations
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/margot")
```

Once installed, run:

```r
library(causalworkshop)
check_workshop_prerequisites()
```

Download the R scripts:

```r
library(causalworkshop)

get_workshop_scripts()  # copies scripts into ./workshop-scripts
list_workshop_scripts()
```

Work through scripts 01–05 **Prior to the workshop** (06 is optional).

## Workshop materials

- The lectures are somewhat technical at the moment. I'll be simplifying them before the workshop and posting YouTube videos prior to the workshop. Stay tuned here for updates.
- Student presentations will be posted here **after** the workshop.  
- Previous talks and examples remain available for reference; we will link to them from the relevant sections.
