## Causal Inference Glossary

::: {.card}
### ðŸ“– Terminology Guide

Causal inference is anchored on mathematical proofs. This brings wide agreement about its foundations. The proofs give us confidence. However, the words people use to describe concepts vary. The terminology  invites confusion. Linked here is a glossary of terminology. Where terminology differs, I've added a note.

**[Download Glossary (PDF)](pdfs/bulbulia-hand-outs/S2-glossary.pdf)**

This glossary contains essential definitions for terms including:
- Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)
- Backdoor paths, confounders, and colliders
- Instrumental variables and propensity scores
- Time-varying confounding and measurement error
- Causal estimands, estimators, and identification strategies
- Words whose meanings differ -- sometimes with opposite meanings -- include "selection", "fixed effects", "standardisation", "estimand", "moderator", "structural equation model", and "identification". 

*Essential reference for understanding causal inference methodology and terminology.*
